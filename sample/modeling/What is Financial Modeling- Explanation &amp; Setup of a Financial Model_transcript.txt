hey everyone eric here in this video

i'm going to help you understand what is

financial modeling and what is the

purpose of a financial model in the real

world

after that we're going to walk step by

step through how to build a simple

financial model

okay let's get started okay so let's

talk about what financial modeling is

and then

talk about the components of a real

financial model

so a financial model shows a prediction

about the future financial performance

of a company

and it's very important that i say the

word future

because anything related to future

predictions is the field of finance

anything related to analyzing and

organizing data about the past

is called accounting so accounting is

more focused on

accuracy in the past and finance is more

focused on

not necessarily getting it perfect but

making good predictions about the future

and of course they'll never be correct

but it's all about trying to build

predictions that make sense so the most

common

type of financial model is called the

income statement or

also known as the profit and loss

statement and the income statement shows

the sales from our business

minus the costs so at the bottom of the

income statement

you have a line that shows us the net

profit of the company which is how much

money

we made or lost from doing business

and so what would we use a financial

model for well

the first thing is to anticipate the

future so we can have an idea

of what's going to happen financially so

that we have the opportunity to make

changes

so for example let's say we want to roll

out a new product at a certain price

point

when we build the financial model we

might see that the price point is too

low

and we're actually going to lose money

we might see that we

need to change some of our costs so it

allows us

to analyze new opportunities about the

future

so that we can have more confidence

about going forward or

maybe we're less confident and we need

to make changes but it gives us

information about things that haven't

happened yet so that's why finance is

very powerful

what else do we use financial models for

well

one of the biggest reasons is to raise

investment capital

so if you need a venture capital

investment for your business because

it's losing money but in the future it's

going to make money

you would need to show financial models

you would need to be able to predict the

future business

to get investors to invest in your

company also if you need to get a loan

so a debt investment you would need

really solid financial models that would

show

that you could pay off the loan so

they're very useful for running

companies

getting investment in companies and just

uh sort of

seeing the future before it happens so

steps to creating financial models so

now we are in the part of the video

where we're going to talk about

how to create a financial model and what

are the basic

sections of a financial model how should

we move through it

so there's a few components of a

financial model

you have step one which is building the

revenue plan

the revenue is the sales it's the same

word

and so to understand what the sales are

going to be you need to understand what

products you're selling

how many orders of each product you

expect what are the prices of each

product and then you need to understand

new customers returning customers

if you have any discounts or promotions

things like that to build

your actual sales next you have

something called the cost of sales

so the cost of sales are all of the

direct costs

related to delivering the product so

when i say direct costs i mean

if you're selling for instance a

clothing item

the direct costs are the thing that

touch the piece of clothing itself

so the materials the labor for the

people that are

involved in the manufacturing of the

clothing maybe shipping from the

clothing

so any costs that are directly touching

the product are in a section called the

cost of sales

next you have something called the

operating expenses

so this is step three of building the

model collecting all the information

and projecting your operating expenses

these are the fixed

costs of the business so things that

don't necessarily touch the product but

that are important

so this would be all your corporate

payroll so these people probably don't

touch the clothing in any way but

they're running the marketing

they might be the ceo there might be the

accounting team

maybe your office rent so you have a lot

of costs that don't touch the product

and then once you've collected all those

costs you can start to understand

what is the profit margin because the

profit margin is the revenue

minus your cost of sales minus your

operating expenses and that is what your

operating profit is

but there's different types of profit

margins you have your gross profit

margin

which has to do directly with the

product itself

you have your operating profit margin

which is your profits

but before taxes and then you have your

net profit which is your profit

after taxes so let's jump into a real

financial model and and walk through how

we build one

by the way if you're finding this

content valuable please like this video

and subscribe to my channel

right now so that you don't miss any of

my new videos

okay so here's the setup for a financial

model that we're going to build right

now

so you can see i put step one step two

step three

and step four next to the sections that

we're gonna build

and this is the format of an income

statement generally at the top

you see revenue then you see costs of

goods sold which are your direct costs

then gross profit which is the profit

that you derive from the sales of the

product but it does not include fixed

costs

operating expenses are your fixed costs

and then you have different types of

profit

depending on if you include or exclude

taxes

so let's walk through how you would

build something like this so step one

revenue plan so

typically with a revenue plan the first

thing you need to figure out is how many

orders you're going to sell

and so let's say we are a clothing

company like i just mentioned

and we have an online store so we're an

e-commerce business we have no physical

locations it's

all a completely digital store

and we are driving sales through online

advertising through facebook and google

and pinterest and reddit and anywhere

else we can do advertising

so to get the number of orders

we need to use something called the

customer acquisition cost

so let's say that the customer

acquisition cost is 40.

so the customer acquisition cost is the

amount of advertising

spend we need to spend to get one new

person to buy for the very first time so

for every forty dollars in marketing

we are able to get one person to buy

so after spending forty dollars in ads

one new person buys so our customer

acquisition cost is 40.

let's say in year two it goes down to 35

and year 3 30 and year 425.

okay so now we have our customer

acquisition cost but now let's talk

about our average order value

so that is the uh the value in sales

of one order on average so let's say our

typical customer

is buying 89

in their typical order so they're buying

a couple different items and on average

if you look at all the sales divided by

all the orders

the typical order is eighty nine dollars

and we spend forty dollars of those

eighty nine dollars on marketing

okay with this information we can

predict the entirety of the revenue

plan so what we're going to do is we're

going to take a hundred thousand dollars

in marketing

and i am just putting that budget out

there to to show

in year one we spend a hundred thousand

year two 250 or three a million year for

three million just to show a business

scaling up over time

but again i just completely made those

numbers up so

if we spend a hundred thousand dollars

in marketing and

it costs us forty dollars in marketing

to get one new order

then the new orders are going to be a

hundred thousand divided by forty

twenty five hundred so here i can copy

this formula across

i can hold down control and tap c

hold down shift right arrow three times

and control and tap v that's paste

so now you can see that here we spend

three million dollars

and every 25 dollars that we spend we

get one new order and that amounts 220

new orders

but a really important part of

predicting financials

is understanding okay someone buys for

the first time but how often do they

come back

and purchase a second time or you know

start to repurchase

so let's put a return rate in the model

of 60 percent

and this is an annual return rate

because i'm looking at this on an annual

basis

it's not a monthly model it's an annual

model

so sixty percent means that of all the

people who bought

in year one sixty percent are going to

come back and buy in year two

so i'm gonna take the total from year

one and multiply it by 60.

and this is going to be 1500 orders ctrl

c right arrow ctrl v copy this over

and then you can see that you have new

orders you have returning orders and

then your total order's down below

so your total orders times

your average revenue per order which is

called your average order value

is going to be your total revenue so

let's go up and remember step one

you stay in step one until step one is

done so it's build the revenue

so i'm just going to link in here orders

i hit the equal sign

go down below link in total orders

it's nice to put something like total

orders at the top not everyone does it

but it gives you a sense of sort of

um you know how much are you selling and

what are some metrics beyond just the

dollars or the

you know the currency uh that reflect

the operations of your business

so for revenue all we need to do is take

total orders times

average order value and so in this case

ctrl c right arrow ctrl v

you'll see that this gives us our annual

sale so it's 220

000 then it's almost 800 then it's 3.5

and it's 12.8

and so we're an e-commerce business and

businesses that sell digitally online

can scale really really fast because

there's nothing that prevents them from

growing they have no physical

infrastructure to limit their growth

all they're doing is just selling and

selling and selling as fast as they can

so really a lot of ecommerce businesses

do grow like this

it's quite common so now let's move on

to

step two cost of sales so the direct

costs related to our product

so if we're manufacturing clothing

and then customers place an order on our

website

we pack their order into a box and then

we ship it

the those are all of our cost of sales

direct costs that touch our product

so let's talk about the cost of goods

sold

cogs per order so

let's say that on average for 189

order the cost of the actual product the

cost of the clothing

is 17 so 17 here

next we're going to have fulfillment so

fulfillment is

the cost to of all the employees working

in the fulfillment center

of the boxes of any packing materials as

well as the

shipping cost to ship it from the

fulfillment center

to get to the customer's door so let's

say that the typical 89

order costs 28 dollars and has 28

dollars in fulfillment costs

and then finally the other thing that

touches the product directly is customer

service

because these people speak directly with

the customers

about the product so we consider that a

cost of sales

cost and we're saying that it's seven

dollars on a per

order basis let's say we have um a team

maybe one or two customer service people

and their salaries divided by the total

orders ends up being about seven dollars

of of customer service cost per order so

now how do we calculate the full numbers

well these are per order cost so we just

need to multiply these numbers

by the number of orders so

let's go ahead and do that up above so

for product i'll just do

equals i'll link in the number of

orders but in this case i'm going to

actually

tap f4 f4 okay

so you can see that i have a dollar sign

here in front

of the 37 in front of the row so that's

going to lock this row

so that i can basically just write this

formula one time

so now i'm going to multiply this by

product cost

and i'll explain that formula to you

here in a second so if i multiply this

across you can see that

your product costs are getting

multiplied the number of orders times

the product but then if i take this

formula

and i copy it down here

and i'm just going to take away the

dollar signs

and with financial models by the way

generally you'll have

a dollar sign so this is called an

accounting format here

on the top row of each block of data and

on the bottom row but in the middle

you do just commas like this and

it's just the best practice that we do

in the industry

and it makes it look a little bit

cleaner okay so what happened when i

copied this formula well because i put

the dollar sign in front of the 37

it continued to be locked to row 37 even

though i copied it down one cell

but because i didn't lock this cell

the reference moved down one row

so what it basically means is that i can

continue copying this formula

and these references will move up and

down if i copy them up and down to

different rows

but the order row is always going to

stay in row 37.

so here you can see that again

i copied this down and the row is still

locked because i'm locked to row 37 with

the dollar sign

but the customer service

per order cost move down one row so

these are called cell references

and i'll include a video i have a video

that goes over sort of locked cell

references and it just improves your

efficiency and allows you to write

fewer and better formulas in excel okay

so now that we have

this all figured out we just need to add

up the cost of goods sold

so i put a little um bottom border on

this

and then hit equal sum open parentheses

and grab the whole section so here you

can see that

we have our total revenue we have our

total cost of sales so now we're done

with step two we built the

assumptions down below and then up above

we built the projections so

now do we go to gross profit well let's

finish up with step three

so step three is forecast your operating

expenses so step three operating

expenses and so in this model

we have a few operating expenses and

the main one is going to be payroll so

i'm going to say that in the first year

there's just like one or two people

working for the business and we have

payroll of a hundred thousand dollars

and we're just running everything on

shopify and kind of doing everything

ourself

but as we grow we hire a few employees

so we hire another employee this year

at fifty thousand dollars then we have

two hundred and fifty thousand dollars

um and then in year four as we're

scaling up we hire a couple more people

we're at three hundred and fifty

thousand dollars

and then we have other expenses and you

know in a real business

you would probably have in the operating

expenses lots of different expenses

you'd have

rent you'd have um you know consultants

you would have legal

you'd have a lot of categories but i'm

just trying to show you what's the basic

setup

so that when you see a more complex

model you will immediately understand

what the sections mean and you'll

understand how the model flows

so in other expenses i'm just saying

this is everything

consultants rent all anything else that

the business has so

let's say in year one it's thirty

thousand dollars because like i said

we're just

you know one or two people working on

this business and then it's fifty

thousand

so maybe we need some more consultants

to help us with marketing to help us

with

uh legal and then it goes up to finally

ninety thousand dollars

okay and let's say that the corporate

tax rate is 28 percent

um in the us it looks like it's going to

be 28 percent

um in the next few years so just putting

that in

so now let's go back that's all we

needed here for step three

operating expenses and the tax rate so

let's link in our number so first we

have payroll so

payroll just link it in equals link it

in

then we have other expenses here

and then marketing we put up above

marketing always goes and your operating

expenses so

don't forget to include your marketing

because that is obviously

the largest expense um one of the

largest expenses at our business

now equals sum open parentheses

ctrl c right arrow ctrl v

so now we finish step three operating

expenses

oh but we have one last thing um

to before we can calculate these two

different types of profit margins here

and here

we do need to calculate the taxes but

that's going to come in step four

so now we're in step four and let's

calculate the profit

margins so the first profit margin that

we have is the gross profit and that's

revenue minus cost of goods sold so

what we do is we take the revenue and we

subtract

cost of goods sold all our direct costs

control c

shift right arrow control v so you can

see in this case i put in this formula

before i started the video

that our gross profit margin which means

the total

gross profit dollars divided by revenue

and for profit margins you always divide

it by revenue

is 42 so this shows us that sort of

after we someone buys the product from

us and then we

make the product and ship it to them and

do the customer service

we have this number left over to

basically pay our full-time staff to pay

our rent

to pay our marketing so 42 gross profit

margin

um and this number can vary wildly

sometimes it's as low as

15 percent and sometimes it's as high as

90 really really depends on the product

itself

okay so next operating expenses so you

have your

operating income your operating income

is your gross profit

minus your operating expenses and i call

that opex but that just means operating

expenses

so here you can see and this is also

called pre-tax

net income because it's your total

profits but before you pay taxes

you can see that in the first two years

it's negative so as our business is

growing

it's actually losing money but in the

third year we basically break even

and then the fourth year we have a very

very large profit

so now that we see the operating income

we're going to have to do

taxes so let's look at taxes any year

where you have

a loss in terms of you know you don't

have any profits for the business

you don't pay taxes because you don't

pay taxes unless you make money

so and these losses you can actually

carry forward to offset

future profits so if i lost a million

dollars last year in my business

and then i made a million dollars this

year i actually won't pay any taxes this

year

because i can use the loss to offset my

gain

so you can use previous year's losses to

offset future gains

until your gains exceed your losses and

so let me show you

quickly with a formula how you can sort

of calculate that

so you you create something called like

a tax loss

i'm calling it an asset and what i'm

doing is i just take the loss here

from this year so if i go up you can see

that i'm just linking in the loss

and then i'm adding the loss

to uh your the the loss from the second

year

so now you can see that we've

accumulated 267 thousand dollars of

losses

and in year three i'm doing the same

thing 267 plus

we had a gain of a hundred thousand but

267 000

plus 100 000 you're still net in a loss

for the business so you don't need to

pay taxes that year

and then this year i took our cumulative

losses and i added the profits

and we finally got to a positive

territory so we're not going to be

paying taxes on

1.8 million of income we're actually

going to be paying taxes on 1.68

because it's all the previous losses um

added to this profit so the profit's a

little lower because some part of the

income is still not taxable

so taxes and again this is just a little

trick

so i'm going to say if the if formula

if our cumulative tax loss asset

is less than zero so if we've

cumulatively made no profits

comma shows zero for taxes

if cumulatively we've started to make a

profit

what we can do is we can multiply

this number by 28

and this is just a simple if formula so

you'll see here that

taxes are shown as zero in all years but

in this year

we have our 1.68

million tax tax loss asset times 28

percent

and we finally pay taxes and this allows

us to calculate our net income

so it's operating income minus taxes

so in year one you can see that our net

income is

negative 62 that's our margin then

negative 17

then three percent and then 11

all right well that's all for today i
