Hedge funds and other institutional investors deploy a spectrum of statistical and quantitative strategies—ranging from classical econometric models to cutting‐edge machine‐learning frameworks—to systematically detect and exploit market patterns while rigorously managing risk. On the “statistical” side, time‐series models like ARCH/GARCH and stochastic‐volatility processes capture volatility dynamics in asset returns; mean‐reversion and pairs‐trading approaches exploit temporary price divergences; factor models decompose returns into systematic risk premia; and Bayesian or ML‐driven techniques (e.g., Kalman filters, reinforcement learning) dynamically adapt signal extraction. On the “quantitative” front, momentum and trend‐following systems ride persistent price trends; risk‐parity and mean‐variance optimization balance risk contributions across assets; high‐frequency trading algorithms harvest microstructure inefficiencies; and deep‐learning methods unlock non‐linear relationships in vast datasets. Below is a structured overview of these principal strategies.

## Statistical Strategies

### Time Series and Volatility Models
Econometric time‐series models such as ARCH and its generalization GARCH model the clustering of volatility by letting conditional variance depend on past errors and variances, thus providing more accurate risk forecasts and informing dynamic position sizing citeturn2search1turn2search0. Stochastic‐volatility frameworks—including the Heston and SABR models—treat volatility itself as a random process that mean‐reverts, enhancing the pricing of options and other derivatives under realistic, time‐varying risk assumptions citeturn2search4turn2search11.

### Mean Reversion and Pairs Trading
Mean‐reversion strategies identify pairs or groups of co‑integrated or highly correlated assets and profit from temporary price divergences by going long the underperformer and short the outperformer, betting on convergence to historical relationships citeturn0search14. Advanced implementations use Kalman filters or flexible least squares (algebraically equivalent to Kalman) to dynamically estimate and trade on evolving spread relationships, especially in high‐frequency contexts citeturn1academia21.

### Factor Models
Multi‑factor frameworks decompose portfolio returns into systematic risk premia—commonly value, size, momentum, and quality—using models like Fama‑French or bet‑against‑beta, enabling targeted factor tilts and risk‐controlled exposures citeturn0search2turn0news23. The Black‑Litterman model further blends equilibrium market returns with investor views in a Bayesian fashion to optimize allocations while mitigating estimation errors citeturn1search11.

### Statistical Arbitrage Frameworks
Statistical‑arbitrage (StatArb) strategies deploy large, diversified equity portfolios and sophisticated statistical or econometric signals to create market‑neutral exposures, capturing small but persistent alpha through high turnover and automated execution citeturn0search1turn0search8. Multi‑factor StatArb augments pure mean‑reversion with momentum, lead/lag, and corporate‐event signals to diversify return sources and adapt to shifting market regimes citeturn0search14.

### Bayesian and Machine Learning Methods
Reinforcement‐learning approaches dynamically learn optimal entry/exit rules for mean‐reversion and StatArb portfolios, adapting to changing market conditions by optimizing reward functions tailored to trading objectives citeturn1search7.
