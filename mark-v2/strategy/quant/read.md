## Quantitative Strategies

### Momentum Strategies
Momentum strategies systematically buy securities exhibiting strong recent relative performance and short those with weak performance, leveraging the tendency for price trends to persist over intermediate horizons citeturn3search1.

### Trend Following
Trend‑following systems use moving‐average crossovers, breakout rules like Donchian’s four‑week high/low, and technical indicators (e.g., Supertrend) to identify and ride sustained uptrends or downtrends across short-, intermediate-, and long‑term horizons citeturn4search8turn4search3.

### Risk Parity & Portfolio Optimization
Risk‑parity allocates capital such that each asset class contributes equally to overall portfolio volatility, promoting diversification and more stable risk‐adjusted returns across varying market cycles citeturn0search2. Complementing this, Markowitz’s mean‑variance optimization constructs efficient frontiers to balance expected returns against portfolio risk, remaining a cornerstone of strategic asset allocation citeturn0search2.

### High‑Frequency Trading
High‑frequency trading (HFT) firms deploy ultra‑low‑latency algorithms to exploit fleeting arbitrage, order‑book imbalances, and microstructure signals—often holding positions for mere milliseconds and executing thousands of trades daily to capture small gains at scale citeturn0search12.

### Deep Learning and AI‑Driven Methods
Deep‑learning frameworks, such as convolutional Transformers applied to residual portfolios, extract complex, non‑linear time‑series signals that enhance traditional StatArb performance and adapt to evolving market dynamics beyond linear econometric approaches citeturn1search3.

By combining these statistical and quantitative building blocks—each rigorously backtested and risk‑managed—hedge funds and institutional quants construct diversified, systematic investment programs aimed at sustainable alpha generation and robust drawdown control.
